 * Basic Energy is keyed by element alone: it has no rules text, so two
 * prints of the same element are always identical in play regardless of
 * whether the name uses the "Basic" prefix. This also works around the
 * API's data being inconsistent for some prints (e.g. sve-8 "Basic Metal
 * Energy" is missing its `types` field entirely while sve-16, the same card
 * in the same set, has `types: ["Metal"]` — the full field-by-field key
 * would treat those as different cards).
 *
 * Trainer cards are keyed by name + subtypes alone, dropping `rules`: unlike
 * Pokémon (where the same name can legitimately have different attacks/HP
 * across sets), a Trainer name is never reused for a different effect, but
 * the API's `rules` text is sometimes incomplete for a given print (e.g.
 * "Counter Gain" in Ascended Heroes is missing one of the three rules lines
 * present on the Surging Sparks print of the same card) — which the full key
 * would otherwise treat as a different card.
